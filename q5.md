## Approach 1:

The double L function takes an integer n as input. It initializes an empty list res.
Then iterates over the range from 0 to n-1, multiplying each number by 2 and appending the result to the list res.
Finally, it returns the list res.
The for loop outside the function calls doubleL(5) and iterates over the returned list, printing each element followed by a colon (:).

## Approach 2:

This approach uses a list comprehension to generate a list containing the doubled values of numbers from 0 to 4 (range(5)).
It iterates over each element in the generated list and prints it followed by a colon (:).

## Approach 3:

The double G function is a generator function defined using the yield keyword.
It takes an integer n as input. It iterates over the range from 0 to n-1, multiplying each number by 2, and yields the result.
The for loop outside the function calls double G(5) and iterates over the values yielded by the generator, printing each value followed by a colon (:).
